This repository contains a Cucumber-based automation framework designed to test . It uses Gherkin syntax for writing feature files and integrates with Selenium/WebDriver (or any other tool you used) for executing automated UI tests.
The goal of this project is to ensure behavior-driven development (BDD) practices are followed, making tests readable and maintainable for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
